This resurgence, particularly evident in the latter half of our four-year analysis, signifies resilience and adaptability in the face of challenges.

Profit, on the other hand, paints a different picture. While there is growth over the four-year span, it doesn't exhibit the same vigorous upward trajectory as sales.
